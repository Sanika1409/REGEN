## main.py

🔧 **Code Overview**: The `main.py` file is a Python script that utilizes various libraries to generate README files for a repository. It's like a 💻 machine that churns out documentation! 🔩

💡 **Importing Libraries**: The code starts by importing essential libraries:
	* `nest_asyncio`: enables asynchronous I/O operations.
	* `ollama` and `ReActAgent` from `llma_index`: provide AI-powered text generation capabilities.
	* `tools`, `get_git_files`, `readme_generator`, `summarize`, and `GitDocs`: custom functions for working with Git repositories and generating documentation.

🌐 **Setting up the Environment**: The script sets the base URL for the Ollama model using an environment variable (`OLLAMA_HOST`) and initializes it. This is like setting the stage for a 🎭 show!

💻 **Creating the Agent**: A `ReActAgent` is created with the following settings:
	* `tools`: an array of custom functions (mentioned earlier) that will be used by the agent.
	* `llm`: the Ollama model initialized earlier, which provides AI-powered text generation capabilities.
	* `verbose`: set to `True`, indicating that the script should print detailed information during execution.
	* `context`: a predefined context string, likely containing guidance for the agent's behavior.

🔁 **Main Loop**: The script enters an infinite loop where it:
	1. Asks the user to input a prompt (or "q" to quit).
	2. Tries to generate a response using the `ReActAgent` with the provided prompt.
	3. If successful, prints the generated result and breaks out of the inner loop.
	4. If not successful (after 3 retries), continues to the next iteration.

📚 **GitDocs Reset**: After processing each prompt, the script resets the `GitDocs._git_docs` variable to None, which likely clears any cached or previously generated documentation.

That's a 🎉 detailed description of the code in `main.py`! 😊



## prompts.py

📄 The `prompts.py` file is a part of the README generator project. Its primary purpose is to generate a detailed README for a given repository.

🔍 Step 1: Find list of files in repo 🔎
The code starts by finding a list of files in the repository, which is crucial for generating the README. This step lays the foundation for the rest of the process.

💻 Step 2: Generate detailed README 💻
Next, the code generates a detailed README for each file found in the previous step. This involves processing and summarizing information about each file to create a comprehensive README.

🔁 Loop through all files 🔁
The code then continues steps 1 and 2 for every file found in the repository. This ensures that a detailed README is generated for each file, providing users with a thorough understanding of the project's contents.

💭 Summary and exit 💭
After all files have been processed, the code summarizes the results and exits the loop, indicating the end of the process.

🔮 In summary, `prompts.py` is responsible for generating READMEs for a repository. It finds file lists, generates detailed READMEs, and loops through each file before summarizing and exiting. 📊



## tools.py

The provided code is part of a Readme-Generator project, which aims to generate accurate README files for GitHub repositories. The `tools.py` file contains various functions and classes that are used to read and process GitHub documents.

To describe the code of `tools.py` accurately in detail with emojis, I will focus on the key components and their interactions:

🔹 **Function Tools**: This is a collection of functions that can be used to perform specific tasks. These include:
	* `get_git_docs`: Retrieves GitHub documents for a given repository.
	* `code_reader_func`: Reads the contents of code files and returns them as a dictionary.
	* `get_git_files`: Filters GitHub files by type (e.g., Python) and removes files containing certain keywords (e.g., "__").
	* `readme_generator_func`: Generates a README file based on the given repository and input file.

🔹 **Class GitDocs**: This class is responsible for managing the cache of GitHub documents. It ensures that the documents are loaded only once and then cached for future use.

🔹 **LLM (Large Language Model) Integration**: The code uses an Ollama LLM to generate text based on input prompts. This integration enables the generation of README files with accurate descriptions using natural language processing techniques.

🔹 **Agent**: The `ReActAgent` class is used to create an interactive AI agent that can be queried with prompts and respond accordingly. In this case, the agent is configured with the `tools.py` functions and the Ollama LLM.

To describe the code of `tools.py`, I will focus on these key components and their interactions:

"**Tools.py**: A collection of reusable functions for processing GitHub documents and generating README files. The `get_git_docs` function retrieves documents, while `code_reader_func` reads file contents. `get_git_files` filters files by type, and `readme_generator_func` generates a README based on the repository and input file. The code also integrates with an Ollama LLM to generate text descriptions and uses an interactive AI agent for querying and response generation."



## main.py

📝 The `main.py` file is a Python script that generates README files for GitHub repositories using an AI-powered agent. 🤖

💻 At the top of the file, it imports necessary modules and libraries, including `nest_asyncio`, `Ollama`, `ReActAgent`, and others. 🔧

🔗 The first few lines of code set up an instance of the Ollama language model, which is used to generate text. This is done by creating an `Ollama` object with a specific model ("llama3:instruct") and base URL. 📊

💪 Next, it defines a list of tools (`tools`) that will be used by the agent. These include functions for getting Git files, generating README text, summarizing text, and others. 🔧

🤖 Then, an instance of the `ReActAgent` class is created, using the previously defined tools and the Ollama language model. This agent is responsible for generating README text based on user input. 💬

💻 The main loop of the program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input (e.g., "Enter a prompt (q to quit):"). If the user enters anything other than "q", the program will generate a README file using the agent and print the result. 📄

🔴 If an exception occurs during this process, the program will retry up to 3 times before giving up. ⏰

💭 Finally, if the number of retries exceeds 3, the program will simply skip to the next iteration of the loop and prompt the user again. 🔁
